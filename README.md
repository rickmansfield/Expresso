# Expresso

## Project Overview
Here I've built a full back-end CRUD API from scratch for Expresso, a local caf√©.

This was a Codecademy capstone project, deomstrating my ability to build all of the routing and database logic for an internal tool for a coffee shop called Expresso.

The Expresso internal tool should allow users to:
- Create, view, update, and delete menus
- Create, view, update, and delete menu items
- Create, view, update, and delete employees
- Create, view, update, and delete employee's timesheets

You can view all of this functionality in action in the video below:

## Steps I took

create the database tables and API routes specified below.

To test this functionality I ran the testing suite and interacted with the API via the provided front-end. 

In the **migration.js** file I wrote table creation logic.

In order for the tests and provided front-end to run properly, I made sure to:
- Create and export my Express app from a root-level file called **server.js**
- Accept and set an optional port argument for my server to listen on from `process.env.PORT` so I could work locally before pushing to github.
- If you are running the code locally then and `process.env.PORT` is not set, server should run on port `4000` (this is where the provided front-end will make requests to)
- I had to accept and set an optional database file argument from `process.env.TEST_DATABASE` in all Express route files that open and modify my database
- Use the root-level **database.sqlite** as my API's database
- **Note:** When loading **database.sqlite** in your JavaScript files, sqlite3 will always try to load **database.sqlite** from the root directory path, `./database.sqlite`, regardless of where the current file is located. Therefore your code will always be `new sqlite3.Database(process.env.TEST_DATABASE || './database.sqlite')` regardless of the file you are writing in if you want to load and rund the code yourself locally. 

### Database Table Properties

## Testing

I Checked for all essential functionality and edge cases, and the project is complete.
However, you may have moved, deleted, changed something inadvertantly. Hence You may wish to run tests. 

To run these tests yourself in your own local environment, first, open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install
all necessary testing dependencies (if you haven't already).
Finally, run `npm test`. You will see a list of tests that ran with information
about whether or not each test passed. After this list, you will see more specific output
about why each failing test failed.

As you implement functionality, run the tests to
ensure you are creating correctly named variables and functions that return the proper values.
The tests will additionally help you identify edge cases that you may not have anticipated
when first writing the functions.
